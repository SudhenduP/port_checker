<h1 id="port-checking-for-multiple-serversports-using-python">Port checking for multiple servers/ports using Python</h1>
<p>port_checker is a python based code using the following module to check if ports are open on many servers.</p>
<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>In my day to day work, I always need the check whether port access to a server is open on not. The usual way to do this is telnet. But many times, the list of server-port could gets huge, and checking each individually was taking a lot of effort. Hence this tool.</p>
